# Fancy Form Demo

This demo contains a small, polished sign-up form with client-side validation, image preview, and an animated submit flow.

Files:

- `index.html` — main demo page
- `styles.css` — styling for layout and animations
- `script.js` — client-side behavior (validation, preview, progress)

To view the form open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder and visit `http://localhost:8080/index.html`:

```bash
# quick preview using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8080

# then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
